# WebGL Assignments 
Some WebGL assignments from my Programming for Computer Graphics course.

The first shows the earth and moon interacting with a table-top. I built the shadow-casting system myself:

The second shows two animated kiwis. I built my own keyframe animation system in WebGL so I could make the animation as smooth as possible:
